    <h3>About us</h3>
    <p>
      The NHS Digital Buying Catalogue is an online marketplace platform. It can be used to find out which clinical IT systems are available to buy from the GP IT Futures framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GP IT Futures procurement framework, which replaces the GP System of Choice (GPSoC) framework, will make a wider range of systems available. The systems have been assessed against a set of Capabilities and Standards to help improve safety, quality and efficiency in GP surgeries.
    </p>
    <p>
      The functionality of the Buying Catalogue will be enhanced and the number of available products – known as Solutions - will increase over time.
